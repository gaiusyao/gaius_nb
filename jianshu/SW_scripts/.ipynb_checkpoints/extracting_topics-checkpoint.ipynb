          "Is there more to this recording?",
          "He says he's the property of Obi-Wan Kenobi, a resident of these parts.  And it's a private message for him.  Quite frankly, sir, I don't know what he's talking about.  Our last master was Captain Antilles, but with what we've been through, this little R2 unit has become a bit eccentric.",
          "Obi-Wan Kenobi?  I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi?",
          "Well, I don't know anyone named Obi-Wan, but old Ben lives out beyond the dune sea.  He's kind of a strange old hermit.",
          "Just you reconsider playing that message for him.",
          "You know, I think that R2 unit we bought might have been stolen.",
          "Well, I stumbled across a recording while I was cleaning him.  He says he belongs to someone called Obi-Wan Kenobi.",

          "Obi-Wan Kenobi... Obi-Wan?  Now thats a name I haven't heard in a long time... a long time.",
          "Oh, he's not dead, no... not yet.",
          "Well of course, of course I know him.  He's me!  I haven't gone by the name Obi-Wan since oh, before you were born.",
          "Then the droid does belong to you.",
          "You fought in the Clone Wars?",
          "I have something here for you.  Your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough, but your uncle wouldn't allow it.  He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan on some damned-fool idealistic crusade like your father did. ",

          "General Kenobi, years ago you served my father in the Clone Wars.  Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire.  I regret that I am unable to present my father's request to you in person, but my ship has fallen under attack and I'm afraid my mission to bring you to Alderaan has failed.  I have placed information vital to the survival of the Rebellion into the memory systems of this R2 unit.  My father will know how to retrieve it.  You must see this droid safely delivered to him on Alderaan.  This is our most desperate hour.  Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope.",
          "He made a fair move.  Screaming about it won't help you.",
          "Not if I can help it.  Chewie... jam it's transmissions.",

          "I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan.  We meet again, at last.  The circle is now complete.",
          "When I left you, I was but the learner; now I am the master.",
          "Only a master of evil, Darth.",

          "Don't try to frighten us with your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader.  Your sad devotion to that ancient religion has not helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes, or given you clairvoyance enough to find the Rebel's hidden fort...",
          "This bickering is pointless.  Lord Vader will provide us with the location of the Rebel fortress by the time this station is operational.  We will then crush the Rebellion with one swift stroke.",

          "Perhaps she would respond to an alternative form of persuasion.",

          "Not after we demonstrate the power of this station.  In a way, you have determined the choice of the planet that'll be destroyed first.  Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the Rebel base, I have chosen to test this station's destructive power... on your home planet of Alderaan.",
          "No!  Alderaan is peaceful.  We have no weapons.  You can't possibly...",

          "Princess Leia.",
          "What happened?",

          "The approach will not be easy.  You are required to maneuver straight down this trench and skim the surface to this point.  The target area is only two meters wide.  It's a small thermal exhaust port, right below the main port.  The shaft leads directly to the reactor system.  A precise hit will start a chain reaction which should destroy the station.",
          "Orbiting the planet at maximum velocity.  The moon with the Rebel base will be in range in thirty minutes.",
          "All flight troops, man your stations.  All flight troops, man your stations.",
          "What good's a reward if you ain't around to use it?  Besides, attacking that battle station ain'tmy idea of courage.  It's more like suicide.",
          "Switch your deflectors on.",
          "We're starting for the target shaft now.",
          "Keep up your visual scanning.  With all this jamming, they'll be on top of you before your scope can pick them up.",

We will then crush the Rebellion with one swift stroke.\", \"These are the same Jawas that sold us Artoo and Threepio.\", \"And, now Your Highness, we will discuss the location of your hidden Rebel base.\", \"They're for sale if you want them.\", \"Yes, indeed.  If it's a fast ship.\", \"It's the ship that made the Kessel run in less than twelve parsecs!\", \"Ten thousand?  We could almost buy our own ship for that!\", \"We haven't that much with us.  But we could pay you two thousand now, plus fifteen when we reach Alderaan.\", \"Her resistance to the mind probe is considerable.  It will be some time before we can extract any information from her.\", \"The final check-out is complete.  All systems are operational.  What course shall we set?\", \"Perhaps she would respond to an alternative form of persuasion.\", \"I think it is time we demonstrate the full power of this station.Set your course for Princess Leia's home planet of Alderaan.\", \"Are you kidding?  At the rate they're gaining...\", \"We've entered the Alderaan system.\", \"Governor Tarkin, I should have expected to find you holding Vader's leash.  I recognized your foul stench when I was brought on board.\", \"Princess Leia, before your execution I would like you to be my guest at a ceremony that will make this battle station operational.  No star system will dare oppose the Emperor now.\", \"The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.\", \"Not after we demonstrate the power of this station.  In a way, you have determined the choice of the planet that'll be destroyed first.  Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the Rebel base, I have chosen to test this station's destructive power... on your home planet of Alderaan.\", \"No!  Alderaan is peaceful.  We have no weapons.  You can't possibly...\", \"You would prefer another target?  A military target?  Then name the system!\", \"I grow tired of asking this.  So it'll be the last time.  Where is the Rebel base?\", \"Dantooine.\", \"There.  You see Lord Vader, she can be reasonable. Continue with the operation.  You may fire when ready.\", \"Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him.\", \"Our scout ships have reached Dantooine.  They found the remains of a Rebel base, but they estimate that it has been deserted for some time.  They are now conducting an extensive search of the surrounding systems.\", \"Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!\", \"Destroyed... by the Empire!\", \"It followed us!\", \"It sure is leaving in a big hurry.  If they identify us, we're in big trouble.\", \"That's no moon!  It's a space station.\", \"It's too big to be a space station.\", \"Turn the ship around!\", \"We're caught in a tractor beam!  It's pulling us in!\", \"To your stations!\", \"They must be trying to return the stolen plans to the princess.  She may yet be of some use to us.\", \"Send a scanning crew on board.  I want every part of this ship checked.\", \"Hey down there, could you give us a hand with this?\", \"They must be delivered safely or other star systems will suffer the same fate as Alderaan.  Your destiny lies along a different path from mine.  The Force will be with you... always!\", \"Yeah, great at getting us into trouble.\", \"Princess Leia.\", \"What happened?\", \"Uh, uh, negative, negative.  We had a reactor leak here now.  Give us a few minutes to lock it down.  Large leak... very dangerous.\", \"Surely he must be dead by now.\", \"Chewie!\", \"What happened?\", \"They aren't here!  Something must have happened to them.  See if they've been captured.\", \"Secure this area until the alert is canceled.\", \"For the moment.  Uh, we're in the main hangar across from the ship.\", \"He certainly has courage.\", \"They're coming through!\", \"They're coming in too fast!\", \"There are still two more of them out there!\", \"That doesn't sound too hard.  Besides, they let us go.  It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape.\", \"Their tracking us!\", \"Not this ship, sister.\", \"At least the information in Artoo is still intact.\", \"When we heard about Alderaan, we were afraid that you were... lost along with your father.\", \"We are approaching the planet Yavin.  The Rebel base is on a moon on the far side.  We are preparing to orbit the planet.\", \"The approach will not be easy.  You are required to maneuver straight down this trench and skim the surface to this point.  The target area is only two meters wide.  It's a small thermal exhaust port, right below the main port.  The shaft leads directly to the reactor system.  A precise hit will start a chain reaction which should destroy the station.\", \"Orbiting the planet at maximum velocity.  The moon with the Rebel base will be in range in thirty minutes.\", \"All flight troops, man your stations.  All flight troops, man your stations.\", \"What good's a reward if you ain't around to use it?  Besides, attacking that battle station ain'tmy idea of courage.  It's more like suicide.\", \"Switch your deflectors on.\", \"We're starting for the target shaft now.\", \"Keep up your visual scanning.  With all this jamming, they'll be on top of you before your scope can pick them up.\", \"... This is Gold Leader.  We're starting out attack run.\", \"Switch power to front deflection screens.\", \"Death Star will be in range in five minutes. \", \"The guns... they've stopped!\", \"They've coming in!  Three marks at two ten.\", \"Stay on target.\", \"Stay on target!\", \"Rebel base, three minutes and closing.\", \"Target's coming up!\", \"Rebel base, thirty seconds and closing.\", \"The Death Star has cleared the planet.

Now she is my only link to find their secret base!\", \"Lord Vader, the battle station plans are not aboard this ship!  And no transmissions were made.  An escape pod was jettisoned during the fighting, but no life forms were aboard.\", \"She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod.  Send a detachment down to retrieve them.  See to it personally, Commander.  There'll be no one to stop us this time.\", \"Join the Rebellion?!  Are you kidding!  How?\", \"What is what?!?  He asked you a question...What is that?\", \"What happened?\", \"Where am I?  I must have taken a bad step...\", \"Quickly, son... they're on the move.\", \"Yes, I was once a Jedi Knight the same as your father.\", \"A young Jedi named Darth Vader, who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil, helped the Empire hunt down and destroy the Jedi Knights.  He betrayed and murdered your father.  Now the Jedi are all but extinct.  Vader was seduced by the dark side of the Force.\", \"Well, the Force is what gives the Jedi his power.  It's an energy field created by all living things.  It surrounds us and penetrates us.  It binds the galaxy together.\", \"Until this battle station is fully operational we are vulnerable.  The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped.  They're more dangerous than you realize.\", \"Dangerous to your starfleet, Commander; not to this battle station!\", \"The regional governors now have direct control over territories.  Fear will keep the local systems in line.  Fear of this battle station.\", \"And what of the Rebellion?  If the Rebels have obtained a complete technical readout of this station, it is possible, however unlikely, that they might find a weakness and exploit it.\", \"Don't try to frighten us with your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader.  Your sad devotion to that ancient religion has not helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes, or given you clairvoyance enough to find the Rebel's hidden fort...\", \"This bickering is pointless.  Lord Vader will provide us with the location of the Rebel fortress by the time this station is operational.  We will then crush the Rebellion with one swift stroke.\", \"These are the same Jawas that sold us Artoo and Threepio.\", \"And, now Your Highness, we will discuss the location of your hidden Rebel base.\", \"They're for sale if you want them.\", \"Yes, indeed.  If it's a fast ship.\", \"It's the ship that made the Kessel run in less than twelve parsecs!\", \"Ten thousand?  We could almost buy our own ship for that!\", \"We haven't that much with us.  But we could pay you two thousand now, plus fifteen when we reach Alderaan.\", \"Her resistance to the mind probe is considerable.  It will be some time before we can extract any information from her.\", \"The final check-out is complete.  All systems are operational.  What course shall we set?\", \"Perhaps she would respond to an alternative form of persuasion.\", \"I think it is time we demonstrate the full power of this station.Set your course for Princess Leia's home planet of Alderaan.\", \"Are you kidding?  At the rate they're gaining...\", \"We've entered the Alderaan system.\", \"Governor Tarkin, I should have expected to find you holding Vader's leash.  I recognized your foul stench when I was brought on board.\", \"Princess Leia, before your execution I would like you to be my guest at a ceremony that will make this battle station operational.  No star system will dare oppose the Emperor now.\", \"The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.\", \"Not after we demonstrate the power of this station.  In a way, you have determined the choice of the planet that'll be destroyed first.  Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the Rebel base, I have chosen to test this station's destructive power... on your home planet of Alderaan.\", \"No!  Alderaan is peaceful.  We have no weapons.  You can't possibly...\", \"You would prefer another target?  A military target?  Then name the system!\", \"I grow tired of asking this.  So it'll be the last time.  Where is the Rebel base?\", \"Dantooine.\", \"There.  You see Lord Vader, she can be reasonable. Continue with the operation.  You may fire when ready.\", \"Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him.\", \"Our scout ships have reached Dantooine.  They found the remains of a Rebel base, but they estimate that it has been deserted for some time.  They are now conducting an extensive search of the surrounding systems.\", \"Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!\", \"Destroyed... by the Empire!\", \"It followed us!\", \"It sure is leaving in a big hurry.  If they identify us, we're in big trouble.\", \"That's no moon!  It's a space station.\", \"It's too big to be a space station.\", \"Turn the ship around!\", \"We're caught in a tractor beam!  It's pulling us in!\", \"To your stations!\", \"They must be trying to return the stolen plans to the princess.  She may yet be of some use to us.\", \"Send a scanning crew on board.  I want every part of this ship checked.\", \"Hey down there, could you give us a hand with this?\", \"They must be delivered safely or other star systems will suffer the same fate as Alderaan.  Your destiny lies along a different path from mine.  The Force will be with you... always!\", \"Yeah, great at getting us into trouble.\", \"Princess Leia.\", \"What happened?\", \"Uh, uh, negative, negative.  We had a reactor leak here now.  Give us a few minutes to lock it down.  Large leak... very dangerous.\", \"Surely he must be dead by now.\", \"Chewie!\", \"What happened?\", \"They aren't here!  Something must have happened to them.  See if they've been captured.\", \"Secure this area until the alert is canceled.\", \"For the moment.  Uh, we're in the main hangar across from the ship.\", \"He certainly has courage.\", \"They're coming through!\", \"They're coming in too fast!\", \"There are still two more of them out there!\", \"That doesn't sound too hard.  Besides, they let us go.  It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape.\", \"Their tracking us!\", \"Not this ship, sister.\", \"At least the information in Artoo is still intact.\", \"When we heard about Alderaan, we were afraid that you were... lost along with your father.\", \"We are approaching the planet Yavin.  The Rebel base is on a moon on the far side.  We are preparing to orbit the planet.\", \"The approach will not be easy.  You are required to maneuver straight down this trench and skim the surface to this point.  The target area is only two meters wide.  It's a small thermal exhaust port, right below the main port.  The shaft leads directly to the reactor system.  A precise hit will start a chain reaction which should destroy the station.\", \"Orbiting the planet at maximum velocity.  The moon with the Rebel base will be in range in thirty minutes.\", \"All flight troops, man your stations.  All flight troops, man your stations.\", \"What good's a reward if you ain't around to use it?  Besides, attacking that battle station ain'tmy idea of courage.  It's more like suicide.\", \"Switch your deflectors on.\", \"We're starting for the target shaft now.\", \"Keep up your visual scanning.  With all this jamming, they'll be on top of you before your scope can pick them up.\", \"... This is Gold Leader.  We're starting out attack run.\", \"Switch power to front deflection screens.\", \"Death Star will be in range in five minutes. \", \"The guns... they've stopped!\", \"They've coming in!  Three marks at two ten.\", \"Stay on target.\", \"Stay on target!\", \"Rebel base, three minutes and closing.\", \"Target's coming up!\", \"Rebel base, thirty seconds and closing.\", \"The Death Star has cleared the planet.

          "Han, Han!  If only you hadn't had to dump that shipment of spice... you understand I just can't make an exception.  Where would I be if every pilot who smuggled for me dumped their shipment at the first sign of an Imperial starship?  It's not good business.",
          "Put your blasters away.  Han, my boy, I'm only doing this because you're the best and I need you.  So, for an extra, say... twenty percent I'll give you a little more time... but this is it.  If you disappoint me again, I'll put a price on your head so large you won't be able to go near a civilized system for the rest of your short life.",
          "Jabba, I'll pay you because it's my pleasure.",
          "Hello, sir.",
          "Why don't you outrun them?  I thought you said this thing was fast.",
          "Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.  I told you I'd outrun 'em.",
          "Anyway, we should be at Alderaan about oh-two-hundred hours.",
          "You mean it controls your actions?",
          "Partially. But it also obeys your commands.",
          "Your eyes can deceive you.  Don't trust them.",
          "Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!",
          "What do you mean?  Where is it?",
          "The entire starfleet couldn't destroy the whole planet.  It'd take a thousand ships with more fire power than I've...",
          "It's an Imperial fighter.",
          "Plug in.  He should be able to interpret the entire Imperial computer network.",
          "What are you talking about?",
          "Okay.  Han, you put these on.",
          "And hope they don't have blasters.",
          "Why didn't you say so before?",
          "I did say so before!",
          "I wasn't notified.  I'll have to clear it.",
          "Uh... had a slight weapons malfunction.  But, uh, everything's perfectly all right now.  We're fine.  We're all fine here, now, thank you.  How are you?",
          "You're who?",
          "Are you there, sir?",
          "If we can just avoid any more female advice, we ought to be able to get out of here.",
          "It's a wonder you're still alive.Will somebody get this big walking carpet out of my way?",
          "Your powers are weak, old man.",
          "Seems okay, if we can get to it.Just hope the old man got the tractor beam out of commission.",
          "I hope the old man got that tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to be a real short trip.  Okay, hit it!",
          "I care!",
          "So... what do you think of her, Han?",
          "You're safe!  We had feared the worst.",
          "Pardon me for asking, sir, but what good are snub fighters going to be against that?",
          "So... you got your reward and you're just leaving then?",
          "Come on!  Why don't you take a look around?  You know what's about to happen, what they're up against.  They could use a good pilot like you.  You're turning your back on them.",
          "Oh, it's Han!  I don't know, I really thought he'd change his mind. ",
          "Sir, Luke is the best bushpilot in the outer rim territories.",
          "Lock S-foils in attack position.",
          "We're in position.  I'm going to cut across the axis and try and draw their fire.",
          "I got a little cooked, but I'm okay.",
          "Watch your back, Luke!",
          "I'd say about twenty guns.  Some on the surface, some on the towers.",
          "I'll take them myself!  Cover me!",
          "We should be able to see it by now.",
          "No sign of any... wait!",
          "Target's coming up!",
          "Luke, trust me.",
          "You must repair him!  Sir, if any of my circuits or gears will help, I'll gladly donate them."

          "I don't like the look of this.",
          "But who's going to fly it, kid!  You?",
          "All right, we'll check it out.",
          "That's the idea I've been looking forward to killing you for a long time.",
          "What a piece of junk.",
          "Which way?",
          "Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to find yourself floating home.  We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace.  Besides, I know a few maneuvers. We'll lose them!",
          "Traveling through hyperspace isn't like dusting crops, boy!  Without precise calculations we could fly right through a star or bounce too close to a supernova and that'd end your trip real quick, wouldn't it?",
          "You'd better get on with your exercises.",
          "Let him have it. It's not wise to upset a Wookiee.",
          "Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him.",
          "Look, going good against remotes is one thing.  Going good against the living?  That's something else.",
          "That's good.  You have taken your first step into a larger world.",
          "Thats what I'm trying to tell you, kid.  It ain't there.  It's been totally blown away.",
          "There aren't any bases around here.  Where did it come from?",
          "It'd be as well to let it go.  It's too far out of range.",
          "Then he must have gotten lost, been part of a convoy or something...",
          "Well, he ain't going to be around long enough to tell anyone about us.",
          "Look at him.  He's heading for that small moon.",
          "Turn the ship around!",
          "Yeah, I think your right.  Full reverse!  Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power.",
          "Why are we still moving towards it?",
          "There's nothin' I can do about it, kid.  I'm in full power.  I'm going to have to shut down.  But they're not going to get me without a fight!",
          "I sense something... a presence I haven't felt since...",
          "Who's the more foolish... the fool or the fool who follows him?",
          "Ben is a great man.",
          "Yeah, great at getting us into trouble.",
          "Well, anything would be better than just hanging around waiting for them to pick us up...",
          "But they're going to kill her!",
          "Better her than me...",
          "Well more wealth that you can imagine.",
          "All right, kid.  But you'd better be right about this!",
          "This is not going to work.",
          "Look out!  He's loose!",
          "Aren't you a little short for a stormtrooper?",
          "The Jedi are extinct, their fire has gone out of the universe.  You, my friend, are all that's left of their religion.",
          "If you're right, he must not be allowed to escape.",
          "There isn't any other way out.",
          "What the hell are you doing?",
          "Wonderful girl!  Either I'm going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her.  Get in there!",
          "Oh!  The garbage chute was a really wonderful idea.  What an incredible smell you've discovered!  Let's get out of here!  Get away from there...",
          "No!  wait!",
          "Put that thing away!  You're going to get us all killed.",
          "Absolutely, Your Worship.  Look, I had everything under control until you led us down here.  You know, it's not going to take them long to figure out what happened to us.",
          "There's something alive in here!",
          "That's your imagination.",
          "Something just moves past my leg!  Look!  Did you see that?",
          "The walls are moving!",
          "Wait a minute!",
          "Take over!See to him!  Look there!",
          "All right.",
          "Well, let's get moving!",
          "Where are you going?",
          "There's no lock!",
          "When I left you, I was but the learner; now I am the master.",
          "Look!",
          "That's it!  We did it!",
          "Are they away?",
          "That doesn't sound too hard.  Besides, they let us go.  It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape.",
          "When we heard about Alderaan, we were afraid that you were... lost along with your father.",
          "What good's a reward if you ain't around to use it?  Besides, attacking that battle station ain'tmy idea of courage.  It's more like suicide.",
          "All right.  Well, take care of yourself, Han... guess that's what you're best at, isn't it?",
          "I only wish Ben were here.",
          "I met your father once when I was just a boy.  He was a great pilot.  You'll do all right.  If you've got half of your father's skill, you'll do better than all right.",
          "We're starting for the target shaft now.",
          "Good shooting, Wedge!",
          "Lost Tiree, lost Dutch.",
          "This is Red Two.  Flying towards you.",
          "You'd better let her loose.",
          "It's away!",
          "... I just lost my starboard engine.",
          "Biggs, Wedge, let's close it up.  We're going in.  We're going in full throttle.",
          "Watch yourself!  Increase speed full throttle!",
          "Wait!",
          "Nothing.  I'm all right.",
          "Look out!",
          "Great shot, kid.  That was one in a million.",
          "We'll get to work on him right away.",
          "He'll be all right."

          "We intercepted no transmissions. Aaah...  This is a consular ship. Were on a diplomatic mission.",
          "Are you sure this things safe?",
          "That's no battle, hot shot... they're just sitting there!  Probably a freighter-tanker refueling.",
          "Leave that to me.  Send a distress signal and then inform the senate that all aboard were killed!",
          "Lord Vader, the battle station plans are not aboard this ship!  And no transmissions were made.  An escape pod was jettisoned during the fighting, but no life forms were aboard.",
          "Yes, sir.",
          "You ought to take it a little easy Luke.  You may be the hottest bushpilot this side of Mos Eisley, but those little Skyhoppers are dangerous.  Keep it up, and one day, whammo, you're going to be nothing more than a dark spot on the down side of a canyon wall.",
          "Your uncle could hold off a whole colony of Sand People with one blaster.",
          "All right, I'll be right there, Aunt Beru.",
          "But it's a whole 'nother year.",
          "It's too dangerous with all the Sand People around.  We'll have to wait until morning.",
          "Sure.  He needs you.  He'd probably only deactivate you for a day or so...",
          "There are two Banthas down there but I don't see any... wait a second, they're Sand People all right.  I can see one of them now.",
          "Yes, I was once a Jedi Knight the same as your father.",
          "Your fathers lightsaber.  This is the weapon of a Jedi Knight.  Not as clumsy or as random as a blaster.",
          "A young Jedi named Darth Vader, who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil, helped the Empire hunt down and destroy the Jedi Knights.  He betrayed and murdered your father.  Now the Jedi are all but extinct.  Vader was seduced by the dark side of the Force.",
          "Until this battle station is fully operational we are vulnerable.  The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped.  They're more dangerous than you realize.",
          "Dangerous to your starfleet, Commander; not to this battle station!",
          "That's impossible!  How will the Emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy?",
          "The regional governors now have direct control over territories.  Fear will keep the local systems in line.  Fear of this battle station.",
          "They didn't.  But we are meant to think they did.  These tracks are side by side.  Sand People always ride single file to hide there numbers.",
          "And these blast points, too accurate for Sand People.  Only Imperial stormtroopers are so precise.",
          "Mos Eisley Spaceport.  You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy.  We must be cautious.",
          "No blasters!  No blaster!",
          "Yes, indeed.  If it's a fast ship.",
          "Yes, I'll bet you have.",
          "With pleasure.",
          "All right, men.  Load your weapons!",
          "Princess Leia, before your execution I would like you to be my guest at a ceremony that will make this battle station operational.  No star system will dare oppose the Emperor now.",
          "I felt a great disturbance in the Force... as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced.  I fear something terrible has happened.",
          "Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.",
          "Yes.",
          "That's no moon!  It's a space station.",
          "It's too big to be a space station.",
          "Yes.",
          "We've captured a freighter entering the remains of the Alderaan system.  It's markings match those of a ship that blasted its way out of Mos Eisley.",
          "There's no one on board, sir.  According to the log, the crew abandoned ship right after takeoff.  It must be a decoy, sir.  Several of the escape pods have been jettisoned.",
          "Yes, sir.",
          "You know, between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, it's a wonder the whole station doesn't know we're here.",
          "Princess Leia.",
          "Everything is under control.  Situation normal.",
          "Yes.",
          "Yes sir?",
          "Open up in there!",
          "Only a master of evil, Darth.",
          "You're sure the homing beacon is secure aboard their ship?  I'm taking an awful risk, Vader.  This had better work.",
          "The technical readouts of that battle station.  I only hope that when the data is analyzed, a weakness can be found.  It's not over yet!",
          "We don't have time for our sorrows, commander.  The battle station has surely tracked us here.It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape.  You must use the information in this R2 unit to plan the attack.  It is our only hope.",
          "Yes.",
          "The battle station is heavily shielded and carries a firepower greater than half the star fleet.Its defenses are designed around a direct large-scale assault.  A small one-man fighter should be able to penetrate the outer defense.",
          "Well, the Empire doesn't consider a small one-man fighter to be any threat, or they'd have a tighter defense.  An analysis of the plans provided by Princess Leia has demonstrated a weakness in the battle station.",
          "The approach will not be easy.  You are required to maneuver straight down this trench and skim the surface to this point.  The target area is only two meters wide.  It's a small thermal exhaust port, right below the main port.  The shaft leads directly to the reactor system.  A precise hit will start a chain reaction which should destroy the station.",
          "That's impossible, even for a computer.",
          "Okay, easy she goes!",
          "The exhaust post is...",
          "Yes, sir.",
          "Keep your eyes open for those fighters!",
          "It's a hit!",
          "My scope shows the tower, but I can't see the exhaust port!  Are you sure the computer can hit it?"

          "You know, I think that R2 unit we bought might have been stolen.",

          "I have something here for you.  Your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough, but your uncle wouldn't allow it.  He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan on some damned-fool idealistic crusade like your father did. ",
          "The Force?",
          "You must learn the ways of the Force if you're to come with me to Alderaan.",
          "Learn about the Force, Luke.",

          "I want to come with you to Alderaan.  There's nothing here for me now.  I want to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi like my father.",

          "Your droids. They'll have to wait outside.  We don't want them here.",
          "Listen, why don't you wait out by the speeder.  We don't want any trouble.",
          "Ten thousand?  We could almost buy our own ship for that!",
          "You bet I could.  I'm not such a bad pilot myself!  We don't have to sit here and listen...",
          "We haven't that much with us.  But we could pay you two thousand now, plus fifteen when we reach Alderaan.",
          "Yes, Greedo.  As a matter of fact, I was just going to see your boss.  Tell Jabba that I've got his money.",
          "Yeah, but this time I got the money.",
          "Even I get boarded sometimes.  Do you think I had a choice?",
          "Perhaps she would respond to an alternative form of persuasion.",
          "I think it is time we demonstrate the full power of this station.Set your course for Princess Leia's home planet of Alderaan.",

          "You would prefer another target?  A military target?  Then name the system!",
          "I grow tired of asking this.  So it'll be the last time.  Where is the Rebel base?",
          "You don't believe in the Force, do you?",
          "Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other.  I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything.  There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny.",
          "I suggest you try it again, Luke.",
          "With the blast shield down, I can't even see.  How am I supposed to fight?",
          "Looks like we're coming up on Alderaan.",

          "Maybe they know what happened.",
          "It followed us!",
          "It sure is leaving in a big hurry.  If they identify us, we're in big trouble.",
          "I think I can get him before he gets there... he's almost in range.",
          "Boy you said it, Chewie.",
          "They're going to execute her.  Look, a few minutes ago you said you didn't want to just wait here to be captured.  Now all you want to do is stay. ",
          "Don't worry, Chewie.  I think I know what he has in mind.",
          "Master Luke, sir!  Pardon me for asking... but, ah... what should Artoo and I do if we're discovered here?",
          "He's going to pull us all apart.",
          "What happened?",
          "Don't underestimate the Force.",
          "Chewie!",
          "Maybe you'd like it back in your cell, Your Highness.",

          "They aren't here!  Something must have happened to them.  See if they've been captured.",
          "Come here, you big coward!",
          "Maybe it's another drill.",
          "Oh, it's nothing.  Don't worry about it.",
          "What good will it do us if he gets himself killed?  Come on!",
          "Don't worry, she'll hold together.",
          "There are still two more of them out there!",
          "Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh?  You know, sometimes I even amaze myself.",

Sir - My first job was programming binary load lifters... very similar to your vaporators.

Pay it no mind.\", \"Is there more to this recording?\", \"I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know what he's talking about?\", \"He says the restraining bolt has short circuited his recording system.  He suggests that if you remove the bolt, he might be able to play back the entire recording.\", \"Well, wait a minute.  Where'd she go?  Bring her back!  Play back the entire message.\", \"Just you reconsider playing that message for him.\", \"Yes, sir.  I think those new droids are going to work out fine.  In fact, I, uh, was also thinking about our agreement about my staying on another season.  And if these new droids do work out, I want to transmit my application to the Academy this year.\", \"You mean the next semester before harvest?\", \"Harvest is when I need you the most.  Only one more season.  This year we'll make enough on the harvest so I'll be able to hire some more hands.  And then you can go to the Academy next year.\", \"It wasn't my fault, sir.  Please don't deactivate me.  I told him not to go, but he's faulty, malfunctioning; kept babbling on about his mission.\", \"Pardon me, sir, but couldn't we go after him?\", \"If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I think you should deactivate the little fugitive until you've gotten him back to your workshop.\", \"Hello there!  Come here my little friend.  Don't be afraid.\", \"The Jundland Wastes are not to be traveled lightly.  Tell me, young Luke, what brings you out this far?\", \"I think we better get indoors.

What kind of talk is that?\", \"You fought in the Clone Wars?\", \"He was the best star-pilot in the galaxy, and a cunning warrior.  I understand you've become quite a good pilot yourself.

I've just received word that the Emperor has dissolved the council permanently.

I'm captain of the Millennium Falcon.  Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the Alderaan system.\", \"Fast ship?  You've never heard of the Millennium Falcon?\", \"I've outrun Imperial starships, not the local bulk-cruisers, mind you.  I'm talking about the big Corellian ships now.  She's fast enough for you, old man.  What's the cargo?\", \"What is it?  Some kind of local trouble?\", \"Let's just say we'd like to avoid any Imperial entanglements.\", \"That's okay.  I'm never coming back to this planet again.\", \"I don't have it with me.  Tell Jabba...\", \"Jabba's through with you.  He has no time for smugglers who drop their shipments at the first sign of an Imperial cruiser.\", \"You can tell that to Jabba.  He may only take your ship.\", \"What do you mean?\", \"If the ship's as fast as he's boasting, we ought to do well.\", \"Han, why you're the best smuggler in the business.  You're too valuable to fry.  He was only relaying my concern at your delays.  He wasn't going to blast you.\", \"Han, Han!  If only you hadn't had to dump that shipment of spice... you understand I just can't make an exception.  Where would I be if every pilot who smuggled for me dumped their shipment at the first sign of an Imperial starship?  It's not good business.\", \"Put your blasters away.  Han, my boy, I'm only doing this because you're the best and I need you.  So, for an extra, say... twenty percent I'll give you a little more time... but this is it.  If you disappoint me again, I'll put a price on your head so large you won't be able to go near a civilized system for the rest of your short life.\", \"Jabba, I'll pay you because it's my pleasure.\", \"Hello, sir.\", \"Why don't you outrun them?  I thought you said this thing was fast.\", \"Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.  I told you I'd outrun 'em.\", \"Anyway, we should be at Alderaan about oh-two-hundred hours.\", \"You mean it controls your actions?\", \"Partially. But it also obeys your commands.\", \"Your eyes can deceive you.  Don't trust them.\", \"Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!\", \"What do you mean?  Where is it?\", \"The entire starfleet couldn't destroy the whole planet.  It'd take a thousand ships with more fire power than I've...\", \"It's an Imperial fighter.\", \"Plug in.  He should be able to interpret the entire Imperial computer network.\", \"What are you talking about?\", \"Okay.  Han, you put these on.\", \"And hope they don't have blasters.\", \"Why didn't you say so before?\", \"I did say so before!\", \"I wasn't notified.  I'll have to clear it.\", \"Uh... had a slight weapons malfunction.  But, uh, everything's perfectly all right now.  We're fine.  We're all fine here, now, thank you.  How are you?\", \"You're who?\", \"Are you there, sir?\", \"If we can just avoid any more female advice, we ought to be able to get out of here.\", \"It's a wonder you're still alive.Will somebody get this big walking carpet out of my way?\", \"Your powers are weak, old man.\", \"Seems okay, if we can get to it.Just hope the old man got the tractor beam out of commission.\", \"I hope the old man got that tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to be a real short trip.  Okay, hit it!\", \"I care!\", \"So... what do you think of her, Han?\", \"You're safe!  We had feared the worst.\", \"Pardon me for asking, sir, but what good are snub fighters going to be against that?\", \"So... you got your reward and you're just leaving then?\", \"Come on!  Why don't you take a look around?  You know what's about to happen, what they're up against.  They could use a good pilot like you.  You're turning your back on them.\", \"Oh, it's Han!  I don't know, I really thought he'd change his mind. \", \"Sir, Luke is the best bushpilot in the outer rim territories.\", \"Lock S-foils in attack position.\", \"We're in position.  I'm going to cut across the axis and try and draw their fire.\", \"I got a little cooked, but I'm okay.\", \"Watch your back, Luke!\", \"I'd say about twenty guns.

Sir - My first job was programming binary load lifters... very similar to your vaporators.

Pay it no mind.\", \"Is there more to this recording?\", \"I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know what he's talking about?\", \"He says the restraining bolt has short circuited his recording system.  He suggests that if you remove the bolt, he might be able to play back the entire recording.\", \"Well, wait a minute.  Where'd she go?  Bring her back!  Play back the entire message.\", \"Just you reconsider playing that message for him.\", \"Yes, sir.  I think those new droids are going to work out fine.  In fact, I, uh, was also thinking about our agreement about my staying on another season.  And if these new droids do work out, I want to transmit my application to the Academy this year.\", \"You mean the next semester before harvest?\", \"Harvest is when I need you the most.  Only one more season.  This year we'll make enough on the harvest so I'll be able to hire some more hands.  And then you can go to the Academy next year.\", \"It wasn't my fault, sir.  Please don't deactivate me.  I told him not to go, but he's faulty, malfunctioning; kept babbling on about his mission.\", \"Pardon me, sir, but couldn't we go after him?\", \"If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I think you should deactivate the little fugitive until you've gotten him back to your workshop.\", \"Hello there!  Come here my little friend.  Don't be afraid.\", \"The Jundland Wastes are not to be traveled lightly.  Tell me, young Luke, what brings you out this far?\", \"I think we better get indoors.

What kind of talk is that?\", \"You fought in the Clone Wars?\", \"He was the best star-pilot in the galaxy, and a cunning warrior.  I understand you've become quite a good pilot yourself.

I've just received word that the Emperor has dissolved the council permanently.

I'm captain of the Millennium Falcon.  Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the Alderaan system.\", \"Fast ship?  You've never heard of the Millennium Falcon?\", \"I've outrun Imperial starships, not the local bulk-cruisers, mind you.  I'm talking about the big Corellian ships now.  She's fast enough for you, old man.  What's the cargo?\", \"What is it?  Some kind of local trouble?\", \"Let's just say we'd like to avoid any Imperial entanglements.\", \"That's okay.  I'm never coming back to this planet again.\", \"I don't have it with me.  Tell Jabba...\", \"Jabba's through with you.  He has no time for smugglers who drop their shipments at the first sign of an Imperial cruiser.\", \"You can tell that to Jabba.  He may only take your ship.\", \"What do you mean?\", \"If the ship's as fast as he's boasting, we ought to do well.\", \"Han, why you're the best smuggler in the business.  You're too valuable to fry.  He was only relaying my concern at your delays.  He wasn't going to blast you.\", \"Han, Han!  If only you hadn't had to dump that shipment of spice... you understand I just can't make an exception.  Where would I be if every pilot who smuggled for me dumped their shipment at the first sign of an Imperial starship?  It's not good business.\", \"Put your blasters away.  Han, my boy, I'm only doing this because you're the best and I need you.  So, for an extra, say... twenty percent I'll give you a little more time... but this is it.  If you disappoint me again, I'll put a price on your head so large you won't be able to go near a civilized system for the rest of your short life.\", \"Jabba, I'll pay you because it's my pleasure.\", \"Hello, sir.\", \"Why don't you outrun them?  I thought you said this thing was fast.\", \"Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.  I told you I'd outrun 'em.\", \"Anyway, we should be at Alderaan about oh-two-hundred hours.\", \"You mean it controls your actions?\", \"Partially. But it also obeys your commands.\", \"Your eyes can deceive you.  Don't trust them.\", \"Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!\", \"What do you mean?  Where is it?\", \"The entire starfleet couldn't destroy the whole planet.  It'd take a thousand ships with more fire power than I've...\", \"It's an Imperial fighter.\", \"Plug in.  He should be able to interpret the entire Imperial computer network.\", \"What are you talking about?\", \"Okay.  Han, you put these on.\", \"And hope they don't have blasters.\", \"Why didn't you say so before?\", \"I did say so before!\", \"I wasn't notified.  I'll have to clear it.\", \"Uh... had a slight weapons malfunction.  But, uh, everything's perfectly all right now.  We're fine.  We're all fine here, now, thank you.  How are you?\", \"You're who?\", \"Are you there, sir?\", \"If we can just avoid any more female advice, we ought to be able to get out of here.\", \"It's a wonder you're still alive.Will somebody get this big walking carpet out of my way?\", \"Your powers are weak, old man.\", \"Seems okay, if we can get to it.Just hope the old man got the tractor beam out of commission.\", \"I hope the old man got that tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to be a real short trip.  Okay, hit it!\", \"I care!\", \"So... what do you think of her, Han?\", \"You're safe!  We had feared the worst.\", \"Pardon me for asking, sir, but what good are snub fighters going to be against that?\", \"So... you got your reward and you're just leaving then?\", \"Come on!  Why don't you take a look around?  You know what's about to happen, what they're up against.  They could use a good pilot like you.  You're turning your back on them.\", \"Oh, it's Han!  I don't know, I really thought he'd change his mind. \", \"Sir, Luke is the best bushpilot in the outer rim territories.\", \"Lock S-foils in attack position.\", \"We're in position.  I'm going to cut across the axis and try and draw their fire.\", \"I got a little cooked, but I'm okay.\", \"Watch your back, Luke!\", \"I'd say about twenty guns.

          "Luke, I didn't come back just to say goodbye...  I shouldn't tell you this, but you're the only one I can trust... and if I don't come back, I want somebody to know.",
          "I feel for you, Luke, you're going to have to learn what seems to be important or what really is important.  What good is all your uncle's work if it's taken over by the Empire?...  You know they're starting to nationalize commerce in the central systems...it won't be long before your uncle is merely a tenant, slaving for the greater glory of the Empire.",
          "So long, Luke.",
          "Luke, tell Owen that if he gets a translator to be sure it speaks Bocce.",

          "There's nothing you could have done, Luke, had you been there.  You'd have been killed, too, and the droids would now be in the hands of the Empire.",
          "I suggest you try it again, Luke.",
          "Be patient, Luke.  Stay and watch over the droids.",

As it was I busted up the Skyhopper pretty bad.  Uncle Owen was pretty upset.  He grounded me for the rest of the season.  You should have been there... it was fantastic.",

          "It looks like Sand People did this, all right.  Look, here are gaffi sticks, bantha tracks.  It's just... I never heard of them hitting anything this big before.",
          "They didn't.  But we are meant to think they did.  These tracks are side by side.  Sand People always ride single file to hide there numbers.",

          "Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.",
          "Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other.  I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything.  There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny.",
          "In my experience, there's no such thing as luck.",

          "There's no one on board, sir.  According to the log, the crew abandoned ship right after takeoff.  It must be a decoy, sir.  Several of the escape pods have been jettisoned.",
          "The ship's all yours.  If the scanners pick up anything, report it immediately.  All right, let's go.",
          "TX-four-one-two.  Why aren't you at your post?  TX-four-one-two, do you copy? ",
          "Take over.  We've got a bad transmitter.  I'll see what I can do.",
          "The tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven locations.  A power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave.",
          "Whatever you say.  I've done more than I bargained for on this trip already.",
          "I want to go with you.",
          "Oh, no!  We've got to do something.",

          "Biggs!  You've picked one up... watch it!",
          "Got him!",
          "Several fighters have broken off from the main group.  Come with me!",
          "Can you see Red Five?",

          "Even I get boarded sometimes.  Do you think I had a choice?",
          "You know, even I get boarded sometimes, Jabba.  I had no choice, but I've gota charter now and I can pay you back, plus a little extra.  I just need some more time.",

          "Go get him!",

          "There'll be no escape for the Princess this time.",
          "The Death Star plans are not in the main computer.",
          "We intercepted no transmissions. Aaah...  This is a consular ship. Were on a diplomatic mission.",
          "If this is a consular ship... where is the Ambassador?",
          "Commander, tear this ship apart until you've found those plans and bring me the Ambassador.  I want her alive!",
          "Hold your fire.  There are no life forms.  It must have been short-circuited.",
          "Don't play games with me, Your Highness.  You weren't on any mercy mission this time.  You passed directly through a restricted system.  Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies.  I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.",
          "Holding her is dangerous.  If word of this gets out, it could generate sympathy for the Rebellion in the senate.",
          "I have traced the Rebel spies to her.  Now she is my only link to find their secret base!",
          "Leave that to me.  Send a distress signal and then inform the senate that all aboard were killed!",
          "Lord Vader, the battle station plans are not aboard this ship!  And no transmissions were made.  An escape pod was jettisoned during the fighting, but no life forms were aboard.",
          "She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod.  Send a detachment down to retrieve them.  See to it personally, Commander.  There'll be no one to stop us this time.",
          "My friend has a friend on Bestine who might help us make contact.",
          "Do you think they'll melt us down?",
          "Hey, what're you trying to push on us?",
          "That old man's just a crazy wizard.  Tomorrow I want you to take that R2 unit into Anchorhead and have its memory flushed.  That'll be the end of it.  It belongs to us now.",
          "An elegant weapon for a morecivilized time.  For over a thousand generations the Jedi Knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the Old Republic.  Before the dark times, before the Empire.",
          "A young Jedi named Darth Vader, who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil, helped the Empire hunt down and destroy the Jedi Knights.  He betrayed and murdered your father.  Now the Jedi are all but extinct.  Vader was seduced by the dark side of the Force.",
          "You must learn the ways of the Force if you're to come with me to Alderaan.",
          "Dangerous to your starfleet, Commander; not to this battle station!",
          "The regional governors now have direct control over territories.  Fear will keep the local systems in line.  Fear of this battle station.",
          "And what of the Rebellion?  If the Rebels have obtained a complete technical readout of this station, it is possible, however unlikely, that they might find a weakness and exploit it.",
          "Any attack made by the Rebels against this station would be a useless gesture, no matter what technical data they've obtained.  This station is now the ultimate power in the universe.  I suggest we use it!",
          "Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed.  The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.",
          "Don't try to frighten us with your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader.  Your sad devotion to that ancient religion has not helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes, or given you clairvoyance enough to find the Rebel's hidden fort...",
          "This bickering is pointless.  Lord Vader will provide us with the location of the Rebel fortress by the time this station is operational.  We will then crush the Rebellion with one swift stroke.",
          "These are the same Jawas that sold us Artoo and Threepio.",
          "Why would Imperial troops want to slaughter Jawas?",
          "And, now Your Highness, we will discuss the location of your hidden Rebel base.",
          "I want to come with you to Alderaan.  There's nothing here for me now.  I want to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi like my father.",
          "Mos Eisley Spaceport.  You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy.  We must be cautious.",
          "They're for sale if you want them.",
          "Don't insult us.  You just watch yourself.  We're wanted men.  I have the death sentence on twelve systems.",
          "It's the ship that made the Kessel run in less than twelve parsecs!",
          "Ten thousand?  We could almost buy our own ship for that!",
          "We haven't that much with us.  But we could pay you two thousand now, plus fifteen when we reach Alderaan.",
          "You can tell that to Jabba.  He may only take your ship.",
          "I think it is time we demonstrate the full power of this station.Set your course for Princess Leia's home planet of Alderaan.",
          "Stop that ship!",
          "We've entered the Alderaan system.",
          "Not after we demonstrate the power of this station.  In a way, you have determined the choice of the planet that'll be destroyed first.  Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the Rebel base, I have chosen to test this station's destructive power... on your home planet of Alderaan.",
          "I grow tired of asking this.  So it'll be the last time.  Where is the Rebel base?",
          "They're on Dantooine.",
          "There.  You see Lord Vader, she can be reasonable. Continue with the operation.  You may fire when ready.",
          "I felt a great disturbance in the Force... as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced.  I fear something terrible has happened.",
          "Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him.",
          "Looks like we're coming up on Alderaan.",
          "Our scout ships have reached Dantooine.  They found the remains of a Rebel base, but they estimate that it has been deserted for some time.  They are now conducting an extensive search of the surrounding systems.",
          "She lied!  She lied to us!",
          "There's another ship coming in.",
          "It followed us!",
          "It sure is leaving in a big hurry.  If they identify us, we're in big trouble.",
          "It's too big to be a space station.",
          "Turn the ship around!",
          "We're caught in a tractor beam!  It's pulling us in!",
          "We've captured a freighter entering the remains of the Alderaan system.  It's markings match those of a ship that blasted its way out of Mos Eisley.",
          "They must be trying to return the stolen plans to the princess.  She may yet be of some use to us.",
          "Send a scanning crew on board.  I want every part of this ship checked.",
          "Hey down there, could you give us a hand with this?",
          "Bring them on!  I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around.",
          "They must be delivered safely or other star systems will suffer the same fate as Alderaan.  Your destiny lies along a different path from mine.  The Force will be with you... always!",
          "Yeah, great at getting us into trouble.",
          "Uh, uh, negative, negative.  We had a reactor leak here now.  Give us a few minutes to lock it down.  Large leak... very dangerous.",
          "Escape may not his plan.  I must face him alone.",
          "Looks like you managed to cut off our only escape route.",
          "They aren't here!  Something must have happened to them.  See if they've been captured.",
          "For the moment.  Uh, we're in the main hangar across from the ship.",
          "There are still two more of them out there!",
          "That doesn't sound too hard.  Besides, they let us go.  It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape.",
          "Their tracking us!",
          "Not this ship, sister.",
          "The technical readouts of that battle station.  I only hope that when the data is analyzed, a weakness can be found.  It's not over yet!",
          "We don't have time for our sorrows, commander.  The battle station has surely tracked us here.It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape.  You must use the information in this R2 unit to plan the attack.  It is our only hope.",
          "We are approaching the planet Yavin.  The Rebel base is on a moon on the far side.  We are preparing to orbit the planet.",
          "The battle station is heavily shielded and carries a firepower greater than half the star fleet.Its defenses are designed around a direct large-scale assault.  A small one-man fighter should be able to penetrate the outer defense.",
          "Man your ships!  And may the Force be with you!",
          "Orbiting the planet at maximum velocity.  The moon with the Rebel base will be in range in thirty minutes.",
          "All flight troops, man your stations.  All flight troops, man your stations.",
          "Stand-by alert.  Death Star approaching.  Estimated time to firing range, fifteen minutes.",
          "We count thirty Rebel ships, Lord Vader.  But they're so small they're evading our turbo-lasers!",
          "Switch power to front deflection screens.",
          "They've coming in!  Three marks at two ten.",
          "Rebel base, three minutes and closing.",
          "Artoo, try and increase the power!",
          "Rebel base, thirty seconds and closing.",
          "The Death Star has cleared the planet.  The Death Star has cleared the planet.",
          "Rebel base, in range.",
          "Stand by to fire at Rebel base."

          "She'll be all right. Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner.",
          "Hey, you're not permitted in there.  It's restricted. You'll be deactivated for sure..",
          "That's no battle, hot shot... they're just sitting there!  Probably a freighter-tanker refueling.",
          "Lord Vader, I should have known.  Only you could be so bold.  The Imperial Senate will not sit stillfor this, when they hear you've attacked a diplomatic...",
          "You're a part of the Rebel Alliance... and a traitor.  Take her away!",

          "Yeah, take it away.",

          "Well, not unless you can alter time, speed up the harvest, or teleport me off this rock!",

          "He says the restraining bolt has short circuited his recording system.  He suggests that if you remove the bolt, he might be able to play back the entire recording.",
          "H'm?  Oh, yeah, well, I guess you're too small to run away on me if I take this off!  Okay.",
          "There you go.",
          "Well, wait a minute.  Where'd she go?  Bring her back!  Play back the entire message.",
          "All right, I'll be right there, Aunt Beru.",
          "Well, see what you can do with him.  I'll be right back.",
          "You mean the next semester before harvest?",
          "Yeah, that's what you said last year when Biggs and Tank left.",
          "It's too dangerous with all the Sand People around.  We'll have to wait until morning.",
          "Well, he'd better have those units in the south range repaired bemidday or there'll be hell to pay!",
          "Deactivate!  Well, on the other hand if you hadn't removed his restraining bolt...",
          "No, you're not.  What kind of talk is that?",
          "Sure, go ahead.",
          "Well, the Force is what gives the Jedi his power.  It's an energy field created by all living things.  It surrounds us and penetrates us.  It binds the galaxy together.",
          "Until this battle station is fully operational we are vulnerable.  The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped.  They're more dangerous than you realize.",
          "That's impossible!  How will the Emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy?",

          "He can go about his business.",
          "You can go about your business.",
          "Well, most of the best freighter pilots can be found here.  Only watch your step.  This place can be a little rough.",
          "I'll be careful than.",
          "Let's just say we'd like to avoid any Imperial entanglements.",
          "Okay.  You guys got yourself a ship.  We'll leave as soon as you're ready.  Docking bay Ninety-four.",
          "All right, we'll check it out.",
          "Jabba's through with you.  He has no time for smugglers who drop their shipments at the first sign of an Imperial cruiser.",
          "It will be enough.",
          "If the ship's as fast as he's boasting, we ought to do well.",
          "Han, my boy, there are times when you disappoint me... why haven't you paid me?  And why did you have to fry poor Greedo like that... after all we've been through together.",
          "Han, Han!  If only you hadn't had to dump that shipment of spice... you understand I just can't make an exception.  Where would I be if every pilot who smuggled for me dumped their shipment at the first sign of an Imperial starship?  It's not good business.",
          "Put your blasters away.  Han, my boy, I'm only doing this because you're the best and I need you.  So, for an extra, say... twenty percent I'll give you a little more time... but this is it.  If you disappoint me again, I'll put a price on your head so large you won't be able to go near a civilized system for the rest of your short life.",
          "All right, men.  Load your weapons!",
          "Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to find yourself floating home.  We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace.  Besides, I know a few maneuvers. We'll lose them!",
          "Traveling through hyperspace isn't like dusting crops, boy!  Without precise calculations we could fly right through a star or bounce too close to a supernova and that'd end your trip real quick, wouldn't it?",
          "Princess Leia, before your execution I would like you to be my guest at a ceremony that will make this battle station operational.  No star system will dare oppose the Emperor now.",
          "You would prefer another target?  A military target?  Then name the system!",
          "Are you all right?  What's wrong?",
          "Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.  I told you I'd outrun 'em.",
          "This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.",
          "That's good.  You have taken your first step into a larger world.",
          "Stand by, Chewie, here we go.  Cut in the sublight engines.",
          "It's an Imperial fighter.",
          "No.  It's a short range fighter.",
          "It'd be as well to let it go.  It's too far out of range.",
          "That's no moon!  It's a space station.",
          "Yeah, I think your right.  Full reverse!  Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power.",
          "Plug in.  He should be able to interpret the entire Imperial computer network.",
          "I didn't hear you give any ideas...",
          "Well, anything would be better than just hanging around waiting for them to pick us up...",
          "Well, who... who has he found?",
          "Princess Leia.",
          "Well more wealth that you can imagine.",
          "All right, kid.  But you'd better be right about this!",
          "All right.",
          "Okay.  Han, you put these on.",
          "I wasn't notified.  I'll have to clear it.",
          "The Jedi are extinct, their fire has gone out of the universe.  You, my friend, are all that's left of their religion.",
          "The princess!  Put all sections on alert!",
          "If you're right, he must not be allowed to escape.",
          "There isn't any other way out.",
          "Well, I didn't...",
          "All right.",
          "Listen to them!  They're dying, Artoo!  Curse my metal body!  I wasn't fast enough.  It's all my fault!  My poor master!",
          "We're all right.  You did great.",
          "We're right above you.  Stand by.",
          "Now's our chance!  Go!",
          "You in, kid?  Okay, stay sharp!",
          "Are they away?",
          "They have just made the jump into hyperspace.",
          "You needn't worry about your reward.  If money is all that you love, then that's what you'll receive!",
          "Well, the Empire doesn't consider a small one-man fighter to be any threat, or they'd have a tighter defense.  An analysis of the plans provided by Princess Leia has demonstrated a weakness in the battle station.",
          "The approach will not be easy.  You are required to maneuver straight down this trench and skim the surface to this point.  The target area is only two meters wide.  It's a small thermal exhaust port, right below the main port.  The shaft leads directly to the reactor system.  A precise hit will start a chain reaction which should destroy the station.",
          "Only a precise hit will set up a chain reaction.  The shaft is ray-shielded, so you'll have to use proton torpedoes.",
          "It's not impossible.  I used to bullseye womp rats in my T-sixteen back home.  They're not much bigger than two meters.",
          "What good's a reward if you ain't around to use it?  Besides, attacking that battle station ain'tmy idea of courage.  It's more like suicide.",
          "All right.  Well, take care of yourself, Han... guess that's what you're best at, isn't it?",
          "Are you all right?",
          "I'd say about twenty guns.  Some on the surface, some on the towers.",
          "I'll take them myself!  Cover me!",
          "It's away!",
          "Negative!  It didn't go in, it just impacted on the surface.",
          "We'll stay back far enough to cover you.",
          "Watch yourself!  Increase speed full throttle!",
          "You worry about those fighters!  I'll worry about the tower!",
          "Let him go!  Stay on the leader!",
          "Now let's blow this thing and go home!",
          "He'll be all right."

He has no time for smugglers who drop their shipments at the first sign of an Imperial cruiser.\", \"It will be enough.\", \"If the ship's as fast as he's boasting, we ought to do well.\", \"Han, my boy, there are times when you disappoint me... why haven't you paid me?  And why did you have to fry poor Greedo like that... after all we've been through together.\", \"Han, Han!  If only you hadn't had to dump that shipment of spice... you understand I just can't make an exception.  Where would I be if every pilot who smuggled for me dumped their shipment at the first sign of an Imperial starship?  It's not good business.\", \"Put your blasters away.  Han, my boy, I'm only doing this because you're the best and I need you.  So, for an extra, say... twenty percent I'll give you a little more time... but this is it.  If you disappoint me again, I'll put a price on your head so large you won't be able to go near a civilized system for the rest of your short life.\", \"All right, men.  Load your weapons!\", \"Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to find yourself floating home.  We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace.  Besides, I know a few maneuvers. We'll lose them!\", \"Traveling through hyperspace isn't like dusting crops, boy!  Without precise calculations we could fly right through a star or bounce too close to a supernova and that'd end your trip real quick, wouldn't it?\", \"Princess Leia, before your execution I would like you to be my guest at a ceremony that will make this battle station operational.  No star system will dare oppose the Emperor now.\", \"You would prefer another target?  A military target?  Then name the system!\", \"Are you all right?  What's wrong?\", \"Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.  I told you I'd outrun 'em.\", \"This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.\", \"That's good.  You have taken your first step into a larger world.\", \"Stand by, Chewie, here we go.  Cut in the sublight engines.\", \"It's an Imperial fighter.\", \"No.  It's a short range fighter.\", \"It'd be as well to let it go.  It's too far out of range.\", \"That's no moon!  It's a space station.\", \"Yeah, I think your right.  Full reverse!  Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power.\", \"Plug in.  He should be able to interpret the entire Imperial computer network.\", \"I didn't hear you give any ideas...\", \"Well, anything would be better than just hanging around waiting for them to pick us up...\", \"Well, who... who has he found?\", \"Princess Leia.\", \"Well more wealth that you can imagine.\", \"All right, kid.  But you'd better be right about this!\", \"All right.\", \"Okay.  Han, you put these on.\", \"I wasn't notified.  I'll have to clear it.\", \"The Jedi are extinct, their fire has gone out of the universe.  You, my friend, are all that's left of their religion.\", \"The princess!  Put all sections on alert!\", \"If you're right, he must not be allowed to escape.\", \"There isn't any other way out.\", \"Well, I didn't...\", \"All right.\", \"Listen to them!  They're dying, Artoo!  Curse my metal body!  I wasn't fast enough.  It's all my fault!  My poor master!\", \"We're all right.  You did great.\", \"We're right above you.  Stand by.\", \"Now's our chance!  Go!\", \"You in, kid?  Okay, stay sharp!\", \"Are they away?\", \"They have just made the jump into hyperspace.\", \"You needn't worry about your reward.  If money is all that you love, then that's what you'll receive!\", \"Well, the Empire doesn't consider a small one-man fighter to be any threat, or they'd have a tighter defense.  An analysis of the plans provided by Princess Leia has demonstrated a weakness in the battle station.\", \"The approach will not be easy.  You are required to maneuver straight down this trench and skim the surface to this point.  The target area is only two meters wide.  It's a small thermal exhaust port, right below the main port.  The shaft leads directly to the reactor system.  A precise hit will start a chain reaction which should destroy the station.\", \"Only a precise hit will set up a chain reaction.  The shaft is ray-shielded, so you'll have to use proton torpedoes.\", \"It's not impossible.  I used to bullseye womp rats in my T-sixteen back home.  They're not much bigger than two meters.\", \"What good's a reward if you ain't around to use it?  Besides, attacking that battle station ain'tmy idea of courage.  It's more like suicide.\", \"All right.  Well, take care of yourself, Han... guess that's what you're best at, isn't it?\", \"Are you all right?\", \"I'd say about twenty guns.  Some on the surface, some on the towers.\", \"I'll take them myself!  Cover me!\", \"It's away!\", \"Negative!  It didn't go in, it just impacted on the surface.\", \"We'll stay back far enough to cover you.\", \"Watch yourself!  Increase speed full throttle!\", \"You worry about those fighters!  I'll worry about the tower!\", \"Let him go!  Stay on the leader!\", \"Now let's blow this thing and go home!\", \"He'll be all right.\"], \"x\": [-14.274941444396973, 0.46247735619544983, -8.666996002197266, -5.860488414764404, -6.14508581161499, -5.106188774108887, -5.783054828643799, -14.48227596282959, -4.371304035186768, -3.189408779144287, -1.7867522239685059, -4.277982711791992, -13.926825523376465, -13.198211669921875, -9.788531303405762, -12.865232467651367, -2.856985569000244, -11.806413650512695, -10.424602508544922, -11.191412925720215, -0.05035896599292755, 2.322298049926758, -13.440093994140625, -14.028973579406738, -14.346949577331543, -5.45068883895874, -2.7490804195404053, -13.638155937194824, -13.569401741027832, 2.092597246170044, -4.999696254730225, -3.0825257301330566, -3.081979513168335, -14.231661796569824, -1.733349084854126, -4.85291862487793, -12.406416893005371, -12.879535675048828, -5.556634426116943, 2.2727622985839844, -15.12524127960205, -3.5313854217529297, -1.350611925125122, 2.447791337966919, -8.998779296875, -0.5137310028076172, -10.133967399597168, -12.935656547546387, -4.680943012237549, -8.973748207092285, -14.386326789855957, -4.653183460235596, 1.2433358430862427, -3.1187422275543213, -2.6566710472106934, -2.6930289268493652, -13.860983848571777, -8.085165023803711, -5.398128032684326, -3.2417190074920654, 0.5076074600219727, -13.763456344604492, -14.401914596557617, -3.171055793762207, -14.36889934539795, -10.360858917236328, -8.835174560546875, -3.9049158096313477, -1.7697309255599976, -5.312854290008545, -3.2477664947509766, -6.937340259552002, 0.33098268508911133, -13.906251907348633, -8.83278751373291, 5.142853736877441, -8.95631217956543, -8.856741905212402, -2.7903778553009033, 2.4334990978240967, 0.49812373518943787, -0.7633245587348938, -0.8244455456733704, -14.797471046447754, -14.281208038330078, -4.986868858337402, -8.565645217895508, -11.961853981018066, -12.510846138000488, -8.833948135375977, -2.122992753982544, -1.856717586517334, 0.4981568157672882, -4.139270782470703, -13.238327026367188, -0.7374358773231506, -1.3613032102584839, -3.2101051807403564, -4.318586826324463, -8.989129066467285], \"y\": [-3.117636203765869, 7.083590507507324, -2.3965229988098145, -3.2720930576324463, 8.846814155578613, 6.961073875427246, -2.5637290477752686, -3.723212242126465, 8.402103424072266, 2.00117826461792, -0.7880370020866394, 1.3011775016784668, -3.426947832107544, -4.819465160369873, -0.3006554841995239, -5.172404766082764, 2.047027349472046, -4.379098892211914, -3.9805920124053955, -4.421952724456787, 1.6286386251449585, -1.205641746520996, -3.4065520763397217, -3.8386244773864746, -3.601414918899536, -3.2505598068237305, 1.005131721496582, 11.066221237182617, 10.839066505432129, 0.3454831540584564, 8.57260799407959, 2.0098907947540283, 2.0100018978118896, -4.3539652824401855, 1.589933156967163, 1.6882274150848389, -5.2898640632629395, -4.123321533203125, 9.981643676757812, 0.31828632950782776, -4.187110424041748, 0.4416419267654419, -2.5562798976898193, -33.80562973022461, -1.5587596893310547, -21.23072624206543, -3.4343769550323486, 11.934420585632324, 10.996541023254395, -0.9906802773475647, -3.8938357830047607, 5.450658798217773, -1.6386889219284058, 2.300816774368286, 9.67691421508789, 9.864633560180664, -3.9660305976867676, 11.267982482910156, -0.7625495791435242, 4.292949676513672, 6.173031806945801, -2.2549750804901123, -3.3642096519470215, 10.444717407226562, -3.39680552482605, -3.9062135219573975, -1.3658206462860107, 3.120997905731201, 1.4992740154266357, 8.493887901306152, 9.91934585571289, -2.9214272499084473, 9.572216033935547, -3.4564361572265625, -1.3662819862365723, -3.49652361869812, -1.7032195329666138, -1.3667640686035156, 1.947807788848877, 1.858609914779663, 8.777056694030762, 10.33183765411377, 0.4856460988521576, 12.0630464553833, 11.903136253356934, 6.316520690917969, 1.036696434020996, 11.471277236938477, -5.53963565826416, -1.3664655685424805, 3.215606451034546, -0.5712835192680359, 8.777073860168457, 1.805810809135437, -4.13093376159668, 9.83852481842041, 2.6893482208251953, 2.2300760746002197, 1.2459826469421387, -1.438124179840088], \"type\": \"scatter\", \"uid\": \"f8ba79d5-9020-11e8-be77-0024d6c0edbe\"}],\n",

He has no time for smugglers who drop their shipments at the first sign of an Imperial cruiser.\", \"It will be enough.\", \"If the ship's as fast as he's boasting, we ought to do well.\", \"Han, my boy, there are times when you disappoint me... why haven't you paid me?  And why did you have to fry poor Greedo like that... after all we've been through together.\", \"Han, Han!  If only you hadn't had to dump that shipment of spice... you understand I just can't make an exception.  Where would I be if every pilot who smuggled for me dumped their shipment at the first sign of an Imperial starship?  It's not good business.\", \"Put your blasters away.  Han, my boy, I'm only doing this because you're the best and I need you.  So, for an extra, say... twenty percent I'll give you a little more time... but this is it.  If you disappoint me again, I'll put a price on your head so large you won't be able to go near a civilized system for the rest of your short life.\", \"All right, men.  Load your weapons!\", \"Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to find yourself floating home.  We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace.  Besides, I know a few maneuvers. We'll lose them!\", \"Traveling through hyperspace isn't like dusting crops, boy!  Without precise calculations we could fly right through a star or bounce too close to a supernova and that'd end your trip real quick, wouldn't it?\", \"Princess Leia, before your execution I would like you to be my guest at a ceremony that will make this battle station operational.  No star system will dare oppose the Emperor now.\", \"You would prefer another target?  A military target?  Then name the system!\", \"Are you all right?  What's wrong?\", \"Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs.  I told you I'd outrun 'em.\", \"This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.\", \"That's good.  You have taken your first step into a larger world.\", \"Stand by, Chewie, here we go.  Cut in the sublight engines.\", \"It's an Imperial fighter.\", \"No.  It's a short range fighter.\", \"It'd be as well to let it go.  It's too far out of range.\", \"That's no moon!  It's a space station.\", \"Yeah, I think your right.  Full reverse!  Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power.\", \"Plug in.  He should be able to interpret the entire Imperial computer network.\", \"I didn't hear you give any ideas...\", \"Well, anything would be better than just hanging around waiting for them to pick us up...\", \"Well, who... who has he found?\", \"Princess Leia.\", \"Well more wealth that you can imagine.\", \"All right, kid.  But you'd better be right about this!\", \"All right.\", \"Okay.  Han, you put these on.\", \"I wasn't notified.  I'll have to clear it.\", \"The Jedi are extinct, their fire has gone out of the universe.  You, my friend, are all that's left of their religion.\", \"The princess!  Put all sections on alert!\", \"If you're right, he must not be allowed to escape.\", \"There isn't any other way out.\", \"Well, I didn't...\", \"All right.\", \"Listen to them!  They're dying, Artoo!  Curse my metal body!  I wasn't fast enough.  It's all my fault!  My poor master!\", \"We're all right.  You did great.\", \"We're right above you.  Stand by.\", \"Now's our chance!  Go!\", \"You in, kid?  Okay, stay sharp!\", \"Are they away?\", \"They have just made the jump into hyperspace.\", \"You needn't worry about your reward.  If money is all that you love, then that's what you'll receive!\", \"Well, the Empire doesn't consider a small one-man fighter to be any threat, or they'd have a tighter defense.  An analysis of the plans provided by Princess Leia has demonstrated a weakness in the battle station.\", \"The approach will not be easy.  You are required to maneuver straight down this trench and skim the surface to this point.  The target area is only two meters wide.  It's a small thermal exhaust port, right below the main port.  The shaft leads directly to the reactor system.  A precise hit will start a chain reaction which should destroy the station.\", \"Only a precise hit will set up a chain reaction.  The shaft is ray-shielded, so you'll have to use proton torpedoes.\", \"It's not impossible.  I used to bullseye womp rats in my T-sixteen back home.  They're not much bigger than two meters.\", \"What good's a reward if you ain't around to use it?  Besides, attacking that battle station ain'tmy idea of courage.  It's more like suicide.\", \"All right.  Well, take care of yourself, Han... guess that's what you're best at, isn't it?\", \"Are you all right?\", \"I'd say about twenty guns.  Some on the surface, some on the towers.\", \"I'll take them myself!  Cover me!\", \"It's away!\", \"Negative!  It didn't go in, it just impacted on the surface.\", \"We'll stay back far enough to cover you.\", \"Watch yourself!  Increase speed full throttle!\", \"You worry about those fighters!  I'll worry about the tower!\", \"Let him go!  Stay on the leader!\", \"Now let's blow this thing and go home!\", \"He'll be all right.\"], \"x\": [-14.274941444396973, 0.46247735619544983, -8.666996002197266, -5.860488414764404, -6.14508581161499, -5.106188774108887, -5.783054828643799, -14.48227596282959, -4.371304035186768, -3.189408779144287, -1.7867522239685059, -4.277982711791992, -13.926825523376465, -13.198211669921875, -9.788531303405762, -12.865232467651367, -2.856985569000244, -11.806413650512695, -10.424602508544922, -11.191412925720215, -0.05035896599292755, 2.322298049926758, -13.440093994140625, -14.028973579406738, -14.346949577331543, -5.45068883895874, -2.7490804195404053, -13.638155937194824, -13.569401741027832, 2.092597246170044, -4.999696254730225, -3.0825257301330566, -3.081979513168335, -14.231661796569824, -1.733349084854126, -4.85291862487793, -12.406416893005371, -12.879535675048828, -5.556634426116943, 2.2727622985839844, -15.12524127960205, -3.5313854217529297, -1.350611925125122, 2.447791337966919, -8.998779296875, -0.5137310028076172, -10.133967399597168, -12.935656547546387, -4.680943012237549, -8.973748207092285, -14.386326789855957, -4.653183460235596, 1.2433358430862427, -3.1187422275543213, -2.6566710472106934, -2.6930289268493652, -13.860983848571777, -8.085165023803711, -5.398128032684326, -3.2417190074920654, 0.5076074600219727, -13.763456344604492, -14.401914596557617, -3.171055793762207, -14.36889934539795, -10.360858917236328, -8.835174560546875, -3.9049158096313477, -1.7697309255599976, -5.312854290008545, -3.2477664947509766, -6.937340259552002, 0.33098268508911133, -13.906251907348633, -8.83278751373291, 5.142853736877441, -8.95631217956543, -8.856741905212402, -2.7903778553009033, 2.4334990978240967, 0.49812373518943787, -0.7633245587348938, -0.8244455456733704, -14.797471046447754, -14.281208038330078, -4.986868858337402, -8.565645217895508, -11.961853981018066, -12.510846138000488, -8.833948135375977, -2.122992753982544, -1.856717586517334, 0.4981568157672882, -4.139270782470703, -13.238327026367188, -0.7374358773231506, -1.3613032102584839, -3.2101051807403564, -4.318586826324463, -8.989129066467285], \"y\": [-3.117636203765869, 7.083590507507324, -2.3965229988098145, -3.2720930576324463, 8.846814155578613, 6.961073875427246, -2.5637290477752686, -3.723212242126465, 8.402103424072266, 2.00117826461792, -0.7880370020866394, 1.3011775016784668, -3.426947832107544, -4.819465160369873, -0.3006554841995239, -5.172404766082764, 2.047027349472046, -4.379098892211914, -3.9805920124053955, -4.421952724456787, 1.6286386251449585, -1.205641746520996, -3.4065520763397217, -3.8386244773864746, -3.601414918899536, -3.2505598068237305, 1.005131721496582, 11.066221237182617, 10.839066505432129, 0.3454831540584564, 8.57260799407959, 2.0098907947540283, 2.0100018978118896, -4.3539652824401855, 1.589933156967163, 1.6882274150848389, -5.2898640632629395, -4.123321533203125, 9.981643676757812, 0.31828632950782776, -4.187110424041748, 0.4416419267654419, -2.5562798976898193, -33.80562973022461, -1.5587596893310547, -21.23072624206543, -3.4343769550323486, 11.934420585632324, 10.996541023254395, -0.9906802773475647, -3.8938357830047607, 5.450658798217773, -1.6386889219284058, 2.300816774368286, 9.67691421508789, 9.864633560180664, -3.9660305976867676, 11.267982482910156, -0.7625495791435242, 4.292949676513672, 6.173031806945801, -2.2549750804901123, -3.3642096519470215, 10.444717407226562, -3.39680552482605, -3.9062135219573975, -1.3658206462860107, 3.120997905731201, 1.4992740154266357, 8.493887901306152, 9.91934585571289, -2.9214272499084473, 9.572216033935547, -3.4564361572265625, -1.3662819862365723, -3.49652361869812, -1.7032195329666138, -1.3667640686035156, 1.947807788848877, 1.858609914779663, 8.777056694030762, 10.33183765411377, 0.4856460988521576, 12.0630464553833, 11.903136253356934, 6.316520690917969, 1.036696434020996, 11.471277236938477, -5.53963565826416, -1.3664655685424805, 3.215606451034546, -0.5712835192680359, 8.777073860168457, 1.805810809135437, -4.13093376159668, 9.83852481842041, 2.6893482208251953, 2.2300760746002197, 1.2459826469421387, -1.438124179840088], \"type\": \"scatter\", \"uid\": \"f8ba79d5-9020-11e8-be77-0024d6c0edbe\"}],\n",

          "Hold your fire.  There are no life forms.  It must have been short-circuited.",
          "I almost forgot.  There's a battle going on!  Right here in our system.  Come and look!",
          "Lord Vader, the battle station plans are not aboard this ship!  And no transmissions were made.  An escape pod was jettisoned during the fighting, but no life forms were aboard.",
          "What a desolate place this is.",
          "What mission?  What are you talking about?  I've had just about enough of you!  Go that way!  You'll be malfunctioning within a day, you nearsighted scrap pile!",
          "That malfunctioning little twerp.  This is all his fault!  He tricked me into going this way, but he'll do no better.",
          "Then I guess I won't see you.",
          "I have no need for a protocol droid.",
          "Luke, take these two over to the garage, will you?  I want you to have both of them cleaned up before dinner.",
          "Yeah, take it away.",
          "And I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, Artoo-Detoo.",
          "Have you been in many battles?",
          "Yes, sir.  I think those new droids are going to work out fine.  In fact, I, uh, was also thinking about our agreement about my staying on another season.  And if these new droids do work out, I want to transmit my application to the Academy this year.",
          "You mean the next semester before harvest?",
          "What are you doing hiding there?",
          "Oh, no!",
          "No, he's not going to try anything.",
          "Can you stand?  We've got to get out of here before the Sand People return.",
          "I seem to have found it.",
          "The Rebellion will continue to gain support in the Imperial Senate as long as....",
          "Go on, go on.  I can't understand how we got by those troopers.  I thought we were dead.",
          "It's the ship that made the Kessel run in less than twelve parsecs!",
          "Ten thousand?  We could almost buy our own ship for that!",
          "We haven't that much with us.  But we could pay you two thousand now, plus fifteen when we reach Alderaan.",
          "Looks like somebody's beginning to take an interest in your handiwork.",
          "Yes, Greedo.  As a matter of fact, I was just going to see your boss.  Tell Jabba that I've got his money.",
          "Over my dead body.",
          "That's the idea I've been looking forward to killing you for a long time.",
          "With pleasure.",
          "You watch your language!",
          "Come on out, Solo!",
          "Jabba, I'll pay you because it's my pleasure.",
          "What a piece of junk.",
          "It looks like an Imperial cruiser.  Our passengers must be hotter than I thought.  Try and hold them off.  Angle the deflector shield while I make the calculations for the jump to light speed.",
          "What's that flashing?",
          "Governor Tarkin, I should have expected to find you holding Vader's leash.  I recognized your foul stench when I was brought on board.",
          "Not after we demonstrate the power of this station.  In a way, you have determined the choice of the planet that'll be destroyed first.  Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the Rebel base, I have chosen to test this station's destructive power... on your home planet of Alderaan.",
          "Dantooine.",
          "There.  You see Lord Vader, she can be reasonable. Continue with the operation.  You may fire when ready.",
          "What?",
          "Look, going good against remotes is one thing.  Going good against the living?  That's something else.",
          "That's good.  You have taken your first step into a larger world.",
          "The ship's all yours.  If the scanners pick up anything, report it immediately.  All right, let's go.",
          "I want to go with you.",
          "Oh, no!  We've got to do something.",
          "Marching into the detention area is not what I had in mind.",
          "Go get him!",
          "Uh... had a slight weapons malfunction.  But, uh, everything's perfectly all right now.  We're fine.  We're all fine here, now, thank you.  How are you?",
          "We're sending a squad up.",
          "Open up in there!",
          "Oh, no!",
          "This is some rescue.  When you came in here, didn't you have a plan for getting out?",
          "Grab him!",
          "Threepio!  Come in Threepio!  Threepio!  Where could he be?",
          "Take over!See to him!  Look there!",
          "Threepio!  Come in, Threepio!  Threepio!",
          "Hurry!",
          "Thank goodness, they haven't found them!  Where could they be?",
          "No.  Shut them all down!  Hurry!",
          "Listen to them!  They're dying, Artoo!  Curse my metal body!  I wasn't fast enough.  It's all my fault!  My poor master!",
          "If we can just avoid any more female advice, we ought to be able to get out of here.",
          "Where are you going?",
          "Come here, you big coward!",
          "Do you know what's going on?",
          "See-Threepio, do you copy?",
          "Come on, buddy, we're not out of this yet!",
          "You needn't worry about your reward.  If money is all that you love, then that's what you'll receive!",
          "Your friend is quite a mercenary.  I wonder if he really cares about anything... or anyone.",
          "Yes.",
          "Only a precise hit will set up a chain reaction.  The shaft is ray-shielded, so you'll have to use proton torpedoes.",
          "That's impossible, even for a computer.",
          "Hey, Luke... may the Force be with you!",
          "What's wrong?",
          "Not on your life!  That little droid and I have been through a lot together.You okay, Artoo?",
          "Okay, easy she goes!",
          "Red Ten standing by.",
          "Keep up your visual scanning.  With all this jamming, they'll be on top of you before your scope can pick them up.",
          "Pull in!  Luke... pull in!",
          "Can you see Red Five?",
          "Hold on!",
          "The guns... they've stopped!",
          "Lost Tiree, lost Dutch.",
          "Red Three, standing by.",
          "I see them.",
          "Just hold them off for a few seconds.",
          "You'd better let her loose.",
          "Artoo, try and increase the power!",
          "Wait!",
          "Rebel base, thirty seconds and closing.",
          "Hang on, Artoo!",
          "Use the Force, Luke.",
          "Luke, trust me.",
          "His computer's off.  Luke, you switched off your targeting computer.  What's wrong?",
          "You may fire when ready.",

          "Are you sure this things safe?",
          "Yes, sir.",
          "Wait, what's that?  A transport!  I'm saved!",
          "I'm sorry.  I'm quiet. Listen how quiet I am.  You can barely hear me...",
          "And I'm stuck here...",
          "No, I'm leaving in the morning...",
          "Look, sir - droids.",
          "Luke, tell Owen that if he gets a translator to be sure it speaks Bocce.",
          "Sir - not in an environment such as this - that's why I've also been programmed for over thirty secondary functions that...",
          "Vaporators!  Sir - My first job was programming binary load lifters... very similar to your vaporators.  You could say...",
          "Of course I can, sir.  It's like a second language for me...  I'm as fluent in Bocce...",
          "Shutting up, sir.",
          "Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit is in prime condition.  A real bargain.",
          "It just isn't fair.  Oh, Biggs is right.  I'm never gonna get out of here!",
          "I don't think so, sir.  I'm only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things.  Not on this planet, anyways.  As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which planet I'm on.",
          "I see, sir.",
          "I see, sir Luke.",
          "With all we've been through, sometimes I'm amazed we're in as good condition as we are, what with the Rebellion and all.",
          "That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning, sir.",
          "Oh, he says it's nothing, sir.  Merely a malfunction.  Old data.  Pay it no mind.",
          "I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.",
          "I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to have picked up a slight flutter.",
          "Sure, there're more than enough droids.",
          "That's what I'm afraid of.",
          "Pardon me, sir, but couldn't we go after him?",
          "Luke, I'm shutting the power down for the night.",
          "Oh, he excels at that, sir.",
          "Sure.  He needs you.  He'd probably only deactivate you for a day or so...",
          "Oh my... sir, he says there are several creatures approaching from the southeast.",
          "Sir, if you'll not be needing me, I'll close down for awhile.",
          "Sure, go ahead.",
          "Alderaan?  I'm not going to Alderaan.  I've got to go home.  It's late, I'm in for it as it is.",
          "I need your help, Luke.  I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.She needs your help.",
          "I'm ready for anything.",
          "I heartily agree with you sir.",
          "I'm sorry.",
          "Han Solo.  I'm captain of the Millennium Falcon.  Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the Alderaan system.",
          "I've outrun Imperial starships, not the local bulk-cruisers, mind you.  I'm talking about the big Corellian ships now.  She's fast enough for you, old man.  What's the cargo?",
          "That's okay.  I'm never coming back to this planet again.",
          "It's too late.  You should have paid him when you had the chance.  Jabba's put a price on your head, so large that every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you.  I'm lucky I found you first.",
          "I'm not the type to run.",
          "Put your blasters away.  Han, my boy, I'm only doing this because you're the best and I need you.  So, for an extra, say... twenty percent I'll give you a little more time... but this is it.  If you disappoint me again, I'll put a price on your head so large you won't be able to go near a civilized system for the rest of your short life.",
          "Hello, sir.",
          "But sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid.",
          "I see your point, sir.  I suggest a new strategy, Artoo.  Let the Wookiee win.",
          "Thats what I'm trying to tell you, kid.  It ain't there.  It's been totally blown away.",
          "No, sir.  If there were any on board, they must also have jettisoned.",
          "Yes, sir.",
          "We found the computer outlet, sir.",
          "I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir. He says \"I found her,\" and keepsrepeating, \"She's here.\"",
          "Level five. Detention block AA-twenty-three.  I'm afraid she's scheduled to be terminated.",
          "Master Luke, sir!  Pardon me for asking... but, ah... what should Artoo and I do if we're discovered here?",
          "What?  Oh... the uniform.  I'm Luke Skywalker.  I'm here to rescue you. ",
          "I'm here to rescue you.  I've got your R2 unit.  I'm here with Ben Kenobi.",
          "Yes sir?",
          "I said, all systems have been alerted to your presence, sir.  The main entrance seems to be the only way out; all other information on your level is restricted.",
          "Wonderful girl!  Either I'm going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her.  Get in there!",
          "I'm trying!",
          "Are you there, sir?",
          "Help!  I think I'm melting!This is all your fault.",
          "You're sure the homing beacon is secure aboard their ship?  I'm taking an awful risk, Vader.  This had better work.",
          "It is for me, sister!  Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess.  I expect to be well paid.  I'm in it for the money!",
          "I'm trying not to, kid!",
          "What're you lookin' at?  I know what I'm doing.",
          "Sir, Luke is the best bushpilot in the outer rim territories.",
          "Thank you, sir.  I'll try.",
          "I got a little cooked, but I'm okay.",
          "I'm on my way in now...",
          "I'm on it.",
          "Hang on, Biggs, I'm coming in.",
          "I'm hit, but not bad.",
          "I'm on him, Luke!",
          "Yes, sir.",
          "We've analyzed their attack, sir, and there is a danger.  Should I have your ship standing by?",
          "I'm in range.",
          "My scope shows the tower, but I can't see the exhaust port!  Are you sure the computer can hit it?",
          "I'm hit!  I can't stay with you.",

Our last master was Captain Antilles, but with what we've been through, this little R2 unit has become a bit eccentric.",
          "Obi-Wan Kenobi?  I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi?",
          "Well, I stumbled across a recording while I was cleaning him.  He says he belongs to someone called Obi-Wan Kenobi.",
          "But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking for him?",
          "Sir, would it help if you told him it was my fault.",
          "Master Luke here is your rightful owner.  We'll have no more of this Obi-Wan Kenobi jibberish... and don't talk to me of your mission, either.  You're fortunate he doesn't blast you into a million pieces right here.",

          "Obi-Wan Kenobi... Obi-Wan?  Now thats a name I haven't heard in a long time... a long time.",
          "No, you're not.  What kind of talk is that?",
          "I have something here for you.  Your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough, but your uncle wouldn't allow it.  He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan on some damned-fool idealistic crusade like your father did. ",
          "General Kenobi, years ago you served my father in the Clone Wars.  Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire.  I regret that I am unable to present my father's request to you in person, but my ship has fallen under attack and I'm afraid my mission to bring you to Alderaan has failed.  I have placed information vital to the survival of the Rebellion into the memory systems of this R2 unit.  My father will know how to retrieve it.  You must see this droid safely delivered to him on Alderaan.  This is our most desperate hour.  Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope.",
          "You must learn the ways of the Force if you're to come with me to Alderaan.",

          "Well, I'm not going that way.  It's much too rocky.  This way is much easier.",
          "Well, things haven't been the same since you left, Biggs.  It's been so...quiet.",
          "Well, I'll be at the Academy next season... after that who knows.  I won't be drafted into the Imperial Starfleet that's for sure...  Take care of yourself, you'll always be the best friend I've got.",
          "All right, come on!  And the red one, come on.  Well, come on, Red, let's go.",

          "Well, if there's a bright center to the universe, you're on the planet that it's farthest from.",
          "Several, I think.  Actually, there's not much to tell.  I'm not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling stories.  Well, not at making them interesting, anyways.",
          "Well, my little friend, you've got something jammed in here real good.  Were you on a starcruiser or...",
          "Well, I don't know anyone named Obi-Wan, but old Ben lives out beyond the dune sea.  He's kind of a strange old hermit.",
          "H'm?  Oh, yeah, well, I guess you're too small to run away on me if I take this off!  Okay.",
